# Commit messages

Our changelog is automatically built from our commit history, using conventional changelog. This means we'd like to take care that:

- commit messages with the prefix `fix:` or `fix(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "Fixes and improvements"
- commit messages with the prefix `feat:` or `feat(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "New features"

If you've made many commits that don't adhere to this style, we recommend squashing 
your commits to a new branch before making a PR. Alternatively, we can do a squash
merge, but you'll lose attribution for your change.
